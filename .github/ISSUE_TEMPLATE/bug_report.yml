        # Filing a report

        Thank you for participating in this project and reporting a bug. Docker Mail Server (DMS) is a community-driven project, and each contribution counts.

        Please **fill out all the fields and checkboxes of this form** to make it easier for maintainers to understand the problem and to solve it. The maintainers and moderators are volunteers that need you to fill this template with accurate informations in order to help you in the best and quickest way. We will have to label your request with `meta/no template - no support` if your request is sloppy and provides no way to help you correctly.

        **Make sure** you read through the whole [README](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/master/README.md), the [documentation](https://docker-mailserver.github.io/docker-mailserver/edge/) and the [issue tracker](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before opening a new bug report.

        ## Levels of support

        We provide official support for

        1. OS/ARCH: Linux on amd64/x86_64 or ARMv7 or ARM64
        2. Containerization platform: Docker and Docker Compose (i.e. based on Docker Engine)

        Other configurations are not officially supported, but there are maintainers that may be able to help you. This is the case for

        1. OS/ARCH: macOS
        2. Containerization platform: Kubernetes (K8s)

        Support for these cases is dependent on specific maintainers, and these cases are marked with `not officially supported`. All other cases are not supported and there are very likely no maintainers that can help you. These cases are marked with `unsupported`.

        **You are not obliged to answer this question**.
        We do encourage answering though as it provides context to better assist you.
        Less experienced users tend to make common mistakes, which is ok; by letting us know we can spot those more easily.
        For the more experienced, we can skip ahead and communicate more effectively to resolve the issue ASAP.
