# This workflow checks out code, re-builds an image from cache, performs a container image
# vulnerability scan with Anchore's Grype tool, and integrates the results with GitHub
# Advanced Security code scanning feature.
#
# For more information on the Anchore scan action usage and parameters, see
# https://github.com/anchore/scan-action. For more information on Anchore's container
# image scanning tool Grype, see https://github.com/anchore/grype.
