## Mailbox definitions
##

# Each mailbox is specified in a separate mailbox section. The section name
# specifies the mailbox name. If it has spaces, you can put the name
# "in quotes". These sections can contain the following mailbox settings:
#
# auto:
#   Indicates whether the mailbox with this name is automatically created
#   implicitly when it is first accessed. The user can also be automatically
#   subscribed to the mailbox after creation. The following values are
#   defined for this setting:
#
#     no        - Never created automatically.
#     create    - Automatically created, but no automatic subscription.
#     subscribe - Automatically created and subscribed.
#
# special_use:
#   A space-separated list of SPECIAL-USE flags (RFC 6154) to use for the
#   mailbox. There are no validity checks, so you could specify anything
#   you want in here, but it's not a good idea to use flags other than the
#   standard ones specified in the RFC:
#
#     \All       - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
#                  user's message store.
#     \Archive   - This mailbox is used to archive messages.
#     \Drafts    - This mailbox is used to hold draft messages.
#     \Flagged   - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
#                  user's message store marked with the IMAP \Flagged flag.
#     \Important - This (virtual) mailbox presents all messages in the
#                  user's message store deemed important to user.
#     \Junk      - This mailbox is where messages deemed to be junk mail
#                  are held.
#     \Sent      - This mailbox is used to hold copies of messages that
#                  have been sent.
#     \Trash     - This mailbox is used to hold messages that have been
#                  deleted.
#
# comment:
#   Defines a default comment or note associated with the mailbox. This
#   value is accessible through the IMAP METADATA mailbox entries
#   "/shared/comment" and "/private/comment". Users with sufficient
#   privileges can override the default value for entries with a custom
#   value.

# NOTE: Assumes "namespace inbox" has been defined in 10-mail.conf.
namespace inbox {
  # These mailboxes are widely used and could perhaps be created automatically:
  mailbox Drafts {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Drafts
  }
  mailbox Junk {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Junk
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Trash
  }

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  mailbox Sent {
    auto = subscribe
    special_use = \Sent
  }

  #mailbox "Sent Messages" {
  #  special_use = \Sent
  #}

  #mailbox Archive {
  #  auto = subscribe
  #  special_use = \Archive
  #}

  # If you have a virtual "All messages" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/All {
  #  special_use = \All
  #  comment = All my messages
  #}

  # If you have a virtual "Flagged" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/Flagged {
  #  special_use = \Flagged
  #  comment = All my flagged messages
  #}

  # If you have a virtual "Important" mailbox:
  #mailbox virtual/Important {
  #  special_use = \Important
  #  comment = All my important messages
  #}
}
