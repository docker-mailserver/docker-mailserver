## IMAP specific settings
##

# Maximum IMAP command line length. Some clients generate very long command
# lines with huge mailboxes, so you may need to raise this if you get
# "Too long argument" or "IMAP command line too large" errors often.
#imap_max_line_length = 64k

# IMAP logout format string:
#  %i - total number of bytes read from client
#  %o - total number of bytes sent to client
#imap_logout_format = in=%i out=%o

# Override the IMAP CAPABILITY response. If the value begins with '+',
# add the given capabilities on top of the defaults (e.g. +XFOO XBAR).
#imap_capability = 

# How long to wait between "OK Still here" notifications when client is
# IDLEing.
#imap_idle_notify_interval = 2 mins

# ID field names and values to send to clients. Using * as the value makes
# Dovecot use the default value. The following fields have default values
# currently: name, version, os, os-version, support-url, support-email.
#imap_id_send = 

# ID fields sent by client to log. * means everything.
#imap_id_log =

# Workarounds for various client bugs:
#   delay-newmail:
#     Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP
#     and CHECK commands. Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
#     Mail (<v2.1). Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
#     may show user "Message no longer in server" errors. Note that OE6 still
#     breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
#     "Headers Only".
#   tb-extra-mailbox-sep:
#     Thunderbird gets somehow confused with LAYOUT=fs (mbox and dbox) and
#     adds extra '/' suffixes to mailbox names. This option causes Dovecot to
#     ignore the extra '/' instead of treating it as invalid mailbox name.
#   tb-lsub-flags:
#     Show \Noselect flags for LSUB replies with LAYOUT=fs (e.g. mbox).
#     This makes Thunderbird realize they aren't selectable and show them
#     greyed out, instead of only later giving "not selectable" popup error.
#
# The list is space-separated.
#imap_client_workarounds = 

# Host allowed in URLAUTH URLs sent by client. "*" allows all.
#imap_urlauth_host =

protocol imap {
  # Space separated list of plugins to load (default is global mail_plugins).
  #mail_plugins = $mail_plugins

  # Maximum number of IMAP connections allowed for a user from each IP address.
  # NOTE: The username is compared case-sensitively.
  #mail_max_userip_connections = 10
