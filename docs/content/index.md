### Welcome to the extended documentation for docker-mailserver!

Please first have a look at the [README.md](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/master/README.md) to setup and configure this server. This wiki provides you with advanced configuration, detailed examples, hints - see navigation on the right side.

#### To get you started

1. The script `setup.sh` is supplied with this project. It supports you in configuring and administrating your server. Information on how to get it and how to use it is available [on a dedicated page](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/wiki/Setup-docker-mailserver-using-the-script-setup.sh).
2. Be aware that advanced tasks may still require tweaking environment variables, reading through documentation and sometimes inspecting your running container for debugging purposes. After all, a mail server is a complex arrangement of various programs.
3. A list of all configuration options is provided in [`ENVIRONMENT.md`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/master/ENVIRONMENT.md). The [`README`](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/blob/master/REEADME.md) is a good starting point to understand what this image is capable of.
4. A list of all optional and automatically created configuration files and directories is available [on the dedicated page](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/wiki/List-of-optional-config-files-&-directories).
5. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/wiki/FAQ-and-Tips) for some more tips!
