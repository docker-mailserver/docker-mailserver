# -----------------------------------------------

# empty => uses the `hostname` command to get the mail server's canonical hostname
# => Specify a fully-qualified domainname to serve mail for.  This is used for many of the config features so if you can't set your hostname (e.g. you're in a container platform that doesn't let you) specify it in this environment variable.
OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME=

# REMOVED in version v11.0.0! Use LOG_LEVEL instead.
DMS_DEBUG=0

# Set the log level for DMS.
# This is mostly relevant for container startup scripts and change detection event feedback.

# The default log level is `info`.

# https://github.com/docker-mailserver/docker-mailserver/issues/1405#issuecomment-590106498
# The same can happen for rootless podman. To prevent this, set the value to "none" or configure slirp4netns
